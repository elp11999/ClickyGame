# Clicky Game

* This application is a memory game using React. A list of images will be displayed with click
  handlers registered to each. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for
  the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if an image clicked more than once.
  Each time an image is clicked, the images displayed will be shuffled in a random order.

* This project was a perfect way for me to get introduced to React.

* To get started, clone the repository and check out the code.

* To just run the application, use link https://elp11999.github.io/clickygame/

* Enjoy :)
